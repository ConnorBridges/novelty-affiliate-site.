## The Science of Weighted & Heavy Sleep Masks

### Deep-Pressure Stimulation (DPS) Explained

Weighted sleep masks harness a phenomenon known as deep-pressure stimulation (DPS), a therapeutic technique that applies consistent, gentle pressure to the body. DPS has been studied extensively since the 1990s and shows benefits for anxiety reduction, sleep onset improvement, and autonomic nervous system regulation.³  In one controlled study, participants using a 5‑pound weighted blanket reported a 31% decrease in self-reported anxiety and a 12% increase in serotonin levels.⁴

A heavy sleep mask targets DPS specifically around the eyes and forehead—areas with high density of pressure-sensitive nerve endings. This targeted DPS:

* **Increases parasympathetic activity**, triggering the “rest-and-digest” response.⁵
* **Elevates melatonin secretion**, the hormone responsible for circadian rhythm regulation.⁶
* **Reduces cortisol spikes** often triggered by cortisol’s role in the stress response.⁷

### Light Blockage and Circadian Health

Beyond DPS, total darkness is critical for deep sleep cycles—particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when dreams consolidate and emotional processing occurs. Exposure to even small amounts of light (as low as 8 lux) can suppress melatonin production by up to 23%.⁸ A high-quality heavy mask ensures:

* 100% blockade of visible light, including gap-minimizing around the nose and cheekbones
* Breathable materials that maintain comfort without inducing heat build-up

Armed with this science, let’s explore the market’s top contenders.
